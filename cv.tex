\startcolumns[n=2]
  \setupwhitespace[medium]
  I enjoy exercising
    (going to the gym, and failing that, going for long runs).
  I love whiled-away hours
    walking and exploring with friends,
    and enjoying pints in the local pubs of Colchester.
  I also have several solitary hobbies.
    I draw and paint,
      having executed many commissions.
    I read overly difficult books.
    I love infographics, typography, and typesetting,
      and I enjoy critiquing such things on my blog.
  
  In time past, I've travelled Europe via inter-rail with a group of friends,
    and I would one day love to travel abroad with my girlfriend,
    teaching English as a foreign language.

%  I must admit that my hobbies are mainly solitary.
%    Drawing and painting use considerable time,
%      from mindless scribbling to executing commissions.
%    I read often,
%      favouring difficult books and just occasionally finishing them.
%    I am an ameteur critic of inconsequential things,
%      a dyed-in-the-wool systematizer,
%      and where I see failings I cannot resist tinkering.
%    I fall in love with infographics and typefaces.

%  I enjoy socialising too!:
%    I visit the gym regularly,
%    and, when I get the time, like walking and exploring.
%    I've travelled Europe via inter-rail with a group of friends,
%    and have eventual plans to teach English as a foreign language.
